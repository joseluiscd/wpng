# wpng

A toy PNG parser library implemented in Rust.

## Supported

- PNG Header
- Color palette
- Access to chunks (raw).
- Access to pixels
- Simple transformations (unpacking pixels, reordering palette)

## Not supported

- Interlacing

## Why this project?

- I was bored at the moment.
- I needed to work with palettes, so I studied a bit of the PNG specification.
